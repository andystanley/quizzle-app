# quizzle-app

Quizzle is a quiz app for Android.  The user may try out several preloaded quizzes in categories such as Computer Science, Geography and Biology.  Questions can also be added to existing quizzes and new quizzes can be created.  The users most recent score is tracked and highscores are tracked for each quiz.  All questions are stored in an SQLite database.  

Below are some screenshots that demonstrate the functionality.
